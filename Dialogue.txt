Part 1:
little kid looking at a jar of jam sitting next to a trash can (kid is far away)
little kid realizes stomach growling, hungry for jam
little kid inches closer to trash can

Part 2:
a raccoon pops out of the trash can
raccoon says: what are you doing here

starting Health = 5 (could be changed?)
Goal: try to get to 10
anytime you reach 10, you win cuz you get the jar of jam and the raccoon doesn't
anytime you reach 0, the game ends with you get slayed by the raccoon and the raccoon eats jam triumphantly
if you run out of choices and isn't at 10 or 0, you and raccoon both fight for the jam,
the jar breaks upon hitting the ground and you both don't get anything

Part 3:
choices:
say: nothing and walk away 0
    you notice raccoon eyeing the jar of jam
say: hey how you doing :333 -1
    raccoon: you pervert
    you notice raccoon eyeing the jar of jam
say: I'm just hungry +1
    raccoon: why are you here? there's nothing for you to eat in the trash can
    you turn to leave
    but you notice raccoon eyeing the jar of jam

Part 4:
choices:
slowly reach for the jar of jam 0
    the raccoon also slowly reaches for the jar of jam
    you say: what are you doing?
    you think: oh no the the raccoon is also noticing, i must distract it
lunge for the jam and run away -1
    but turns out: the raccoon is faster, it gets a hold of the jar
    (add multiple fight scenes to stretch it out)
    you think: oh no the raccoon also wants the jam, i must distract it
say: oh look a jar of jam! +1
    the raccoon looks at where you're pointing and spots the jar of jam
    saliva start spilling from the raccoon's mouth, evidently hungry
    you think: oh no the raccoon also wants the jam, i must distract it

Part 5:
you think: but how? i need the raccoon to trust that I'm not hungry for jam
